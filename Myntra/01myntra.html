        <h4>HISTORY OF MYNTRA</h4>
        <p>Becoming India’s no. 1 fashion destination is not an easy feat. Sincere efforts, digital enhancements and a
            team of dedicated personnel with an equally loyal customer base have made Myntra the online platform that it
            is today. The original B2B venture for personalized gifts was conceived in 2007 but transitioned into a
            full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of just a few years. By 2012, Myntra had introduced 350 Indian
            and international brands to its platform, and this has only grown in number each passing year. Today Myntra
            sits on top of the online fashion game with an astounding social media following, a loyalty program
            dedicated to its customers, and tempting, hard-to-say-no-to deals. <br>

            sprees. Download the app on your Android or IOS device this very minute to experience fashion like never
